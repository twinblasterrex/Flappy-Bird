# Flappy-Bird

The Graphics header and src file can be used by anyone. Note they do not include any Shaders. 

I first compiled this on windows using mingwin. I used clion as my ide. You should be able to just change the compile to the compiler of your chose and build the program. The only not deffult c++ library that you need is glfw. Because there is no decated shaders I can not garenty that anything will render on all gpus. I know that it will at lest render on intel intergrated graphics and nvida gpus.
